1. PROBE - Memory Region Enumeration
What It Does:
Lists all memory regions in a process by walking the VAD tree.

How It Works:
Step 1: Locate VAD Tree Root

================================================================================
HOW IT WORKS (PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION)
================================================================================

This project demonstrates two advanced memory anti-forensics techniques:

1. VAD Hiding
-----------------
Unlinks a memory region's metadata (VAD node) from the process's VAD tree, making the region invisible to standard enumeration techniques.

How it works:
- Finds the VAD node for the target region and removes it from the tree.
- The process can still access the memory normally.

Forensic Impact:
- Tools like Process Hacker, VMMap, and Volatility (VAD scan) cannot see the region.
- Physical memory still contains the data, but it is not linked to the process.

2. PTE Manipulation
---------------------
Modifies the Page Table Entry (PTE) for a memory page, typically by clearing the Present bit.

How it works:
- Calculates the PTE address for the target virtual address.
- Reads the current PTE, clears the Present bit, and writes it back.
- The CPU thinks the page isn't in memory; any access triggers a page fault.

Forensic Impact:
- Most tools and scanners cannot access the memory.
- The process will crash if it tries to use the hidden memory.
- Data remains in physical RAM but is hidden from logical view.

3. Usage in the Project
------------------------
- Clones a secret function into a new memory region.
- Wipes the original function from the DLL.
- Allows manipulation (hide/restore) of the cloned region using VAD and PTE techniques via commands.

4. Forensic Impact Summary
---------------------------
- Live tools: Cannot enumerate or access hidden regions.
- Physical memory dumps: Data may still be present, but not linked to the process.
- Advanced forensics: May recover orphaned data, but attribution is difficult.
