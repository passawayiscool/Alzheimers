This repository contains two parts of our project:

## AIcamo
AI-powered system for generating synthetic cybersecurity event data and network traffic using LSTM transformers and GANs. Used for training and testing security tools in realistic environments.

See the [AIcamo/USER_MANUAL.md](AIcamo/USER_MANUAL.md) for detailed documentation.

## Anti-Memory Forensics
Demonstration of anti-forensics techniques that prevent memory dump analysis by manipulating process memory and using kernel-level drivers to evade detection tools.

See the [Anti-Memory Forensics/README.md](Anti-Memory%20Forensics/README.md) for detailed documentation.

**Note:** Each folder contains its own README with complete setup instructions and usage details.
